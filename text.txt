1.View, which is the HTML.
2.Model, which is the data available for the current view.
3.Controller, which is the JavaScript function that makes/changes/removes/controls the data.

When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these properties.

The scope is the binding part between the HTML (view) and the JavaScript (controller). The scope is an object with the available properties and methods. The scope is available for both the view and the controller.

1)By using service() method
2)By using factory() method
3)By using provider() method
